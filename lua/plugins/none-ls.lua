linting and formatting the code:
  * plenty of tools that handles linting and formmatting, but there is an issue.
    examples of linters and formatters are: rubocop, black, eslint, etc.
    issue is all the examples mentioned above are command line tools, and aren't language servers in and of themselves.

  * that's where null-ls helps
    - amazing pluginthat essentially wraps command line tools into a generalized lsp.
    - enabling easy communication b/w these tools and nvim's built-in lsp clients.
    - instead of installing different plugins to handle linting and formatting, we can just use null-ls to wrap our tools
      in a generalized language server and everything else just looks like another language server to nvim.

  * history lesson:
    - null-ls has been deprecated by the creator, could use null-ls anyways
    - none-ls has emerged as a great alternative, which is community managed fork of null-ls.
